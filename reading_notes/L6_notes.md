# Lesson 6: References to GitHub Integration & Hooks

## GitHub Integration

Claude Code GitHub Actions brings Claude to your GitHub workflow. Once you set it up, you can mention `@claude` in any pull request or issue. It can implement code, create pull request and review code. The easiest way to set it up this is through Claude Code in the terminal by running `/install-github-app`.

You can check the documentation [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/github-actions) for more information on how to use this integration. 

## Hooks

Claude Code hooks are shell commands that you can define and can be executed at various points in Claude Codeâ€™s lifecycle (before tool execution, after tool execution, when subagent finishes a task, when claude finishes responding).  

We showed a quick example on hooks in this lesson. If you'd like to learn more about hooks and see more examples, you are encouraged to check out:
