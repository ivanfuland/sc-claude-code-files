# Course Introduction

Welcome to "Claude Code: A highly Agentic Coding Assistant"! Before you get started with the course, you are encouraged to read this note so you can get an idea about the course outline and how to best navigate this course. 

**Note**: To mark this reading item as complete, make sure to scroll down to the end and click on "Mark as Complete".

## Course Format

The course covers best practices and tips on how to use agentic coding with Claude Code. You'll learn these tips through 3 examples:

- codebase for a RAG chatbot (Lessons 2-6)
- e-commerce data analysis (Lesson 7)
- Figma design mockup (Lesson 8)

The lessons are video-only. You can choose to just watch the videos, but if you'd like to check out the code examples, you can find below the corresponding links. And if you'd like to try the lessons' tasks, you would need to install Claude Code and use it directly in your terminal or within your IDE (for example VS Code which is the IDE used in this course). Each lesson is followed by a reading note that includes the prompts used, a summary of Claude Code's features covered in the lesson and some additional notes.

## Link to Course Codebase Examples

1. Codebase for a RAG chatbot (Lessons 2-6)
    - Here's [the repo](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/starting-ragchatbot-codebase.git) of the starting codebase used in lesson 2.
    - Lessons 3-6 add features to the starting codebase.
    - Here's [the state](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/ragchatbot-codebase.git) of the codebase after lesson 5.

    Feel free to fork the starting codebase and follow the lessons' activities.

2. E-commerce data analysis (Lesson 7)
    - Here are [the lesson files](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/sc-claude-code-files/tree/main/lesson7_files).
    - It includes the data, the starting and refactored notebooks, and the dashboard file.

    Feel free to fork this repo, and try lesson 7 tasks using the starting notebook and the data folder.

3. Figma design mockup (Lesson 8)
   - Here's [the link](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/sc-claude-code-files/blob/main/additional_files/key-indicators.fig) to the Figma mockup design (which you can open with [Figma Desktop App](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/5601429983767-Guide-to-the-Figma-desktop-app)).
   - In lesson 8, you will build a Next.js app based on this mockup.
   - Here's the [link](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/FRED-dashboard.git) to the repo of the app we got during filming.    

## Course Activities - Cost Visibility

If you'd like to install Claude Code to try the lessons:
- you can have a Pro (`$20`/month) or Max (`$100`/month) [subscription](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code#:~:text=Pro,Sign%20up). The pro subscription is enough for the lessons' activities, but it doesn't include Opus. 
- Or, you can be billed based on API usage (if you just use sonnet for all the lessons' activities, the total cost for all lessons can be between `$12` and `$20`). In a given session, you can monitor the cost using the `/cost` command.


## Course Prerequisites

You can take the course whether you're a developer, a data scientist/analyst or even non-technical. But to make the best out of the course and to understand the details of the prompts used:
- Basic familiarity of Python is required for lessons 2-7. 
- For lesson 8, the app you'll build is a Next.js app so you may need to be familiar with this framework if you'd like to check the code generated, but don't worry if you're not, you can still try the last lesson to learn how you can use Figma MCP server to import the mock design into Claude's context. 
- Understanding of basic terminal commands would be also helpful. 
- Familiarity with basic git commands would be great (`git add, commit, pull, push`).
